# odin-recipes
This project is to make a main recipe list webpage and add links to recipes that direct you to another webpage with the recipe picture, description, ingredients and steps.

I have demonstrated through this project that I can make a working webpage, add pictures and links through absolute and relatinve links, add lists and headers and work with git remotely and locally.
