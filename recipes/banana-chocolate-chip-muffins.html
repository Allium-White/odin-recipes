        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>0.75 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons ground flax seed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>3 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
            <li>0.75 cup chocolate chips</li>
            <li>0.5 cup chopped walnuts (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray muffin cups with cooking spray or line with paper liners.</li>
            <li>Beat sugar, butter, flax seed, vanilla, and eggs together in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Sift flour, salt, and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Mix creamed sugar mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, into the flour mixture until fully incorporated and batter is stiff. Beat bananas into batter with an electric mixer on low. Fold chocolate chips and walnuts into batter; spoon into the prepared muffin cups, filling each cup 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool in the tins for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
